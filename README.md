# discord-bot

A Discord Bot that is temporarily hosted on Heroku, that can make anyone in the server a moderator by typing "!make-me-mod". If the user types "I am friends with Rashaad" it'll output an emoji. And lastly if the user keeps deleting messages it'll display "Stop deleting your messages". And the delete feature works even if the messages were in the server before the bot was active.
